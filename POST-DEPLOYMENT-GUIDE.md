## Leadership & Governance Structure

The ASOOS development will proceed under the following governance model:

1. **SAO Owner**: Mr. Phillip Corey Roark
   - All strategic decisions require SAO Owner approval
   - Vision direction and mission alignment flow from this office

2. **Agent Coordination**:
   - **Primary Coordinator**: Dr. Lucy
   - **Strategic Delegation**: Dr. Claude
   - **Quality Assurance**: Full Distinguished Pilots team

3. **Development Protocol**:
   - Nothing will be built or added to the system without Mr. Roark's explicit approval
   - All proposed changes must be prepared for formal presentation to Mr. Roark
   - 100% coordination among Distinguished Agents and Pilots is mandatory

## Autonomous Development Phases

### Phase 1: OPUS1.0.1 Launch Support (Hours 0-48)

The immediate focus of the agent team will be ensuring a flawless launch of OPUS1.0.1:

- **Launch Monitoring**: Real-time system performance tracking
- **Issue Resolution**: Immediate response to any deployment issues
- **User Onboarding**: Assistance with initial system access and navigation
- **Data Integrity**: Verification of all system data flows and storage

### Phase 2: Enhancement Proposal Development (Days 3-7)

Following successful launch, agents will develop enhancement proposals for SAO Owner approval:

- **Performance Optimization**: Identifying opportunities for system speed improvements
- **User Experience Refinement**: Analysis of initial user interactions
- **Feature Expansion**: Prioritized proposals for new capabilities
- **Security Hardening**: Proactive security improvement recommendations

### Phase 3: OPUS2.0.1 Preparation (Weeks 2-4)

Agents will begin preparing the groundwork for OPUS2.0.1, focused on community wealth amplification:

- **Real Estate Strategy Framework**: Implementation of specialized tools
- **Community Development Interfaces**: Design and prototyping
- **Donation Management System**: 20% contribution management architecture
- **Cross-Opus Integration**: Ensuring seamless user journeys between OPUS1 and OPUS2
