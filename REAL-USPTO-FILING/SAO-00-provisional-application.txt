PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION

Filed Under 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)

USPTO Customer Number: 208576
Inventor: Phillip Corey Roark

TITLE: Foundational AI Agent Communication Protocol

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS: None

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention:
The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems, and more particularly to protocols enabling standardized communication between AI agents in a multi-agent orchestration system.

Background:
Current AI systems lack standardized protocols for agent-to-agent communication, resulting in inefficient orchestration and limited collaborative capabilities.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a foundational communication protocol that enables AI agents to:
1. Establish authenticated connections
2. Exchange structured messages
3. Coordinate complex tasks
4. Maintain conversation context
5. Handle errors gracefully

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The protocol consists of:
- Message format specification
- Authentication handshake
- Session management
- Error handling procedures
- Performance optimization techniques

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[This is a template - the full technical details from your existing documentation need to be inserted here]

The protocol implements a layered architecture:

Layer 1: Transport
- WebSocket or HTTP/2 connections
- TLS encryption
- Connection pooling

Layer 2: Authentication
- JWT-based agent identity
- Role-based permissions
- Capability negotiation

Layer 3: Messaging
- JSON message format
- Request/response patterns
- Event broadcasting

Layer 4: Orchestration
- Task delegation
- Result aggregation
- Failure recovery

CLAIMS

What is claimed is:

1. A method for enabling communication between artificial intelligence agents comprising:
   - establishing authenticated connections between agents
   - exchanging structured messages using a standardized protocol
   - maintaining session state across interactions
   - coordinating multi-agent task execution

2. The method of claim 1, wherein authentication uses cryptographic signatures.

3. The method of claim 1, wherein message format is extensible for future capabilities.

4. A system implementing the method of claim 1.

5. A computer-readable medium containing instructions for executing the method of claim 1.

[Additional claims to be added based on specific implementation details]

ABSTRACT

A foundational protocol for AI agent communication enabling authenticated, structured message exchange between agents in a multi-agent orchestration system. The protocol provides transport security, agent authentication, standardized messaging formats, and orchestration primitives necessary for coordinating complex AI agent interactions at scale.
