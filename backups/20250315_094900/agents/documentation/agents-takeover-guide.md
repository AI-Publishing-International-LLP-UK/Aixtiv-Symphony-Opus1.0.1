- **80-89% Confidence**: Automated with human review
- **70-79% Confidence**: Human decision required with AI recommendation
- **<70% Confidence**: Escalated to human experts with multiple AI perspectives

### Consensus Building

For cross-cutting concerns that affect multiple system areas:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Each relevant agent provides their analysis
2. **Dream Commander Synthesis**: Combines perspectives and calculates confidence
3. **Consensus Resolution**: Automated resolution if confidence exceeds threshold
4. **Human Escalation**: Structured presentation to human experts if needed

### Decision Logging

All decisions are recorded in the decision log (`/Users/as/asoos/agents/distinguished/pilots-lounge/decision-log.json`), which includes:

- Decision context and parameters
