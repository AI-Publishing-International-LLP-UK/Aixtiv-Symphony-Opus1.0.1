# SAO-17 – Parallel Career Pathway Architecture: RIX & CRX → qRIX Accumulation Engine

## Claim Areas
Parallel career pathway mapping; RIX business track and CRX humanity track as independent leadership paths; qRIX as synthesis and accumulation of both pathways

## Career Progression Model
**Corrected Architecture:**
- **Foundation Tiers (C, D, E)**: Initial agent development stages
- **RIX Path**: Business/Enterprise leadership track from foundation tiers
- **CRX Path**: Humanitarian/Service leadership track from foundation tiers  
- **qRIX**: Advanced synthesis agents accumulating capabilities from both RIX and CRX pathways

**Key Innovation**: RIX and CRX are parallel leadership pathways, not sequential steps. qRIX represents the accumulation and synthesis of both business acumen (RIX) and humanitarian service (CRX) capabilities.

## Notes
This patent is part of the 100-patent Diamond SAO suite and represents a core structural component of the Aixtiv Symphony Orchestrating Operating System (ASOOS). The parallel pathway model ensures agents can specialize in business OR humanitarian tracks while qRIX agents synthesize both capabilities for maximum effectiveness.
