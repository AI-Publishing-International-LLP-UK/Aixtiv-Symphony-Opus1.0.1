# AIXTIV SYMPHONYâ„¢ Database & System Tracking Requirements

## Database Implementation Considerations

### Core Database Structure
- **User Registry**: System-generated unique identifiers for all users
- **Entity Registry**: Tracking of all entities (teams, groups, enterprises, etc.)
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: Parent-child mappings for all user relationships
- **Role Assignments**: Many-to-many relationship tracking for users and roles
- **Solution Access Registry**: Tracks which solutions each user can access
- **Integration Permissions**: Tracks API and app access permissions
- **Security Implementation**: Stores security protocols for each entity

### System Tracking Requirements
- **Creation Timestamp**: When user/entity was created
- **Last Modified Timestamp**: When record was last modified
- **Modification History**: Complete audit trail of all changes
- **Modified By**: User ID of who made each change
- **Status Changes**: History of status changes (active, suspended, etc.)
- **Role Change History**: Timeline of role assignments/revocations
- **Access History**: Record of solution access changes

### Transaction Tables
- **Payment Records**: All payment transactions with timestamps
- **Payment Method Changes**: History of payment method modifications
- **Discount Applications**: Recording when/how discounts were applied
- **Plan Changes**: Tracking of subscription plan modifications
- **Billing Cycle Adjustments**: Changes between monthly/quarterly/annual

### Provisioning System Requirements
- **Automated Role Application**: System to apply role capabilities upon assignment
- **Access Control Management**: Dynamic permission adjustments based on roles
- **Integration Activation**: System to enable/disable integration access
- **Security Protocol Implementation**: Automated security protocol deployment
- **Private Label Configuration**: System to apply correct branding per user type

### Database Constraints
- **Referential Integrity**: Ensure all relationships maintain integrity
- **Business Rules Enforcement**: Database-level enforcement of business rules
- **Code Format Validation**: Ensure all generated codes follow correct format
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Safeguards against duplicate entries
- **Orphan Prevention**: No entities without proper parent relationships

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core User and Entity Management
- Build fundamental user and entity structures
- Implement basic relationship hierarchies
- Create essential tracking mechanisms

### Phase 2: Role and Access Management
- Develop role assignment systems
- Implement solution access registry
- Create integration permission framework

### Phase 3: Advanced Tracking
- Build comprehensive audit trail functionality
- Implement transaction history systems
- Develop payment tracking functionality

### Phase 4: Security and Integration
- Build security protocol implementation system
- Develop API and app access management
- Create private labeling system

## Data Migration Considerations
- **Unique ID Generation**: Algorithm for creating system IDs
- **Relationship Mapping**: Process for establishing hierarchical relationships
- **Historical Data**: Approach for capturing existing relationships
- **Code Assignment**: Methodology for applying coding system to existing users

## Operational Requirements
- **Real-time Updates**: System must reflect changes immediately
- **Change Validation**: Business logic to validate all modifications
- **Notification System**: Alerts for significant system changes
- **Reporting Framework**: Comprehensive reporting on system state
- **Administrative Interface**: Tools for managing code assignments
