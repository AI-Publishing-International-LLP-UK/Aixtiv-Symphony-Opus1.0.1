# AIXTIV Bid Suite: Complete Workflow Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive end-to-end workflows for the Bid Suite, covering the entire journey from initial bid ideation to post-project feedback. Each workflow incorporates Standard Operating Procedures (S2DO) that standardize processes across all bid activities.

## 1. Bid Lifecycle Management Architecture

The Bid Suite implements a complete lifecycle management system with these key components:

// Submit a new bid
const bidResult = await bidManager.submitBid({
  title: "Healthcare Analytics Platform",
  description: "Development of advanced analytics solution for hospital network",
  amount: 250000,
  currency: "USD",
  expiresAt: Timestamp.fromDate(new Date("2025-06-30")),
  ownerId: "user123",
  ownerName: "Alex Johnson",
  category: BidCategory.HEALTHCARE,
  tags: ["analytics", "healthcare", "data science"],
  visibility: BidVisibility.PUBLIC
}, "user123", "Alex Johnson");

// Set up monitoring
const unsubscribe = bidManager.monitorBids({
  statuses: [BidStatus.OPEN, BidStatus.UNDER_REVIEW],
  ownerId: "user123",
  expiringWithinDays: 14
}, (bids) => {
  console.log(`Monitoring ${bids.length} active bids`);
  // Process bids...
});

// Record a win
await bidManager.markBidAsWon(
  "bid123", 
  "user123", 
  "Alex Johnson", 
  {
    finalAmount: 245000,
    winningFactors: ["technical expertise", "competitive pricing"],
    decisionMaker: "Sarah Williams",
    contractLength: "24 months"
  }
);

// Record a loss
await bidManager.markBidAsLost(
  "bid456", 
  "user123", 
  "Alex Johnson", 
  {
    winner: "Competitor Inc.",
    lossFactors: ["price point too high", "timeline constraints"],
    priceDifferential: "15% higher"
  }
);

// Add feedback
await bidManager.addBidFeedback({
  bidId: "bid123",
  authorId: "client456",
  authorName: "Client Organization",
  content: "Proposal was comprehensive and well-structured. Team demonstrated excellent understanding of our requirements.",
