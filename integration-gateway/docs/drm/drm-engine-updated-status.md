# Updated Implementation Status: Content Generation Engine

The `drm-content-generation-engine.py` file demonstrates that the Content Generation Engine is significantly more advanced than initially estimated. This key component is nearly feature complete and follows the Roark 5.0 Authorship Model as specified.

## Implemented Components

### LLM Provider Architecture
- ✅ Abstract `LLMProvider` interface with standardized methods
- ✅ Concrete implementations for OpenAI and Anthropic Claude
- ✅ Factory pattern for provider instantiation
- ✅ Robust fallback mechanism between providers

### Ethical Validation
- ✅ Advanced originality checking
- ✅ Ethical compliance verification
- ✅ JSON-based structured validation results
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting

### Roark 5.0 Authorship Model
- ✅ Enforces human creative leadership (minimum 70% human contribution)
- ✅ Limits AI contribution to maximum 30%
- ✅ Strict validation of contribution percentages
- ✅ Creative passport generation for blockchain registration

### Content Generation Workflow
- ✅ Project initiation from human concepts
- ✅ AI suggestion generation
- ✅ Human contribution validation
- ✅ AI contribution validation and limits
- ✅ Work finalization and validation
- ✅ Cost estimation functionality
