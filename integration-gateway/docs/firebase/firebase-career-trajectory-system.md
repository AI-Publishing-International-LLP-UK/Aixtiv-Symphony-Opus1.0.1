## Key Security Design Principles

### Immediate Neutralization
- Detect unauthorized database schemas instantly
- Execute comprehensive deletion
- Log events across multiple channels

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. Firebase/Firestore Native Architecture
2. Blockchain-based Forensic Logging
3. Emergency Notification System
4. Comprehensive Deletion Protocol

### Compliance Requirements
- Prevent any non-Firebase database schemas
- Maintain complete audit trail
- Trigger immediate remediation
- Notify key stakeholders

## Deployment Considerations
- Use environment-specific service account configurations
- Implement secure secret management
- Regularly rotate access credentials
- Maintain strict access controls

## Ongoing Monitoring
- Continuous schema validation
- Real-time security event tracking
- Immutable logging mechanisms

### Emergency Contact Strategy
- Immediate email notifications
- Multiple communication channel alerts
- Detailed forensic reporting

## Additional Safeguards
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Minimal external dependency injection
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging for forensic analysis
