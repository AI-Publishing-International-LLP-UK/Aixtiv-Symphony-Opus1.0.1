## Implementation Notes

- All workflows use Jenkins Declarative Pipeline syntax for consistency
- Authentication to external systems is handled via the DrLucyAutomation service account
- Environment-specific configurations are stored in parameter files under `jenkins/environments/`
- Notification and alerting are implemented using Slack and email channels
- All workflows include detailed logging and artifact collection
- Workflow results and metrics are tracked in our centralized monitoring system

## Getting Started

To implement a new workflow from this index:

1. Create a new Groovy file in the appropriate subdirectory of `jenkins/workflows/`
2. Use the templates in `jenkins/templates/` as starting points
3. Configure the workflow to use the DrLucyAutomation service account credentials
4. Test the workflow in the development environment before promoting to production
5. Document any special considerations in the workflow file header comments
