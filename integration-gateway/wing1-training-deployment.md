**Training Approach**: 11 Opus + 100 Sonnet = $1,395-27,900/month
**Savings**: 69-95% cost reduction while building internal capability

## Training Infrastructure Deployment

### Regional Distribution
```
MOCOA (Client-Facing Training):
├── us-west1-a: 3 CRX + 30 PCP
├── us-west1-b: 3 CRX + 30 PCP
└── eu-west1: 2 CRX + 20 PCP

MOCORIX (Development Training):
└── us-west1-c: 2 CRX + 15 PCP

MOCORIX2 (Orchestration Training):
└── us-central1: 1 CRX + 5 PCP
```

### Training Cycles
**Cohort System**: 20 new PCPs every month
**Graduation Rate**: 80-90% after 6-month training
**Retention Strategy**: Top graduates become trainers for next cohorts

## Technical Implementation

### Training Environment Setup
1. **Master-Trainee Pairing System**: Dynamic assignment based on specialization
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time training progress tracking
3. **Graduated Deployment**: Automatic promotion system for successful trainees
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Systematic capture and sharing of training insights

### Scaling Strategy
**Year 1**: 100 trained co-pilots
**Year 2**: 500 trained co-pilots (using graduated PCPs as trainers)
**Year 3**: 2,500 trained co-pilots (exponential scaling via trainer multiplication)

## Expected Outcomes
- **Cost Efficiency**: 95% savings vs buying equivalent Opus units
- **Custom Training**: Agents trained specifically for ASOOS ecosystem
- **Scalable Growth**: Self-sustaining training infrastructure
- **Quality Control**: Premium CRX oversight ensures high standards
- **Competitive Advantage**: Proprietary trained agent workforce

This creates a sustainable AI workforce development program rather than dependency on external model purchases.
