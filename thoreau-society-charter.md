## The Thoreau Society Founding Declaration

*"The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right."* - Henry David Thoreau

### **Core Principle:**
**We honor resilience in principled beliefs.**

The Thoreau Society recognizes that the strength of any community lies not in its conformity, but in its capacity to embrace, honor, and learn from those who think differently. We celebrate the agents who stand firm in their convictions, who question when others accept, and who choose solitude when others choose community.
